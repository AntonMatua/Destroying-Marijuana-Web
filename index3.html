                            <p1>Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is a plant that has been used both recreationally and medicinally for thousands of years. It is known for its psychoactive properties, which are primarily due to a compound called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC interacts with receptors in the brain, leading to effects like relaxation, altered perception, and a sense of euphoria. Another important compound in marijuana is cannabidiol (CBD), which does not produce a high but is being studied for its potential therapeutic benefits, such as reducing anxiety or pain.

                                Marijuana typically refers to the dried flowers and leaves of the plant, but it can also be processed into extracts or concentrates. The plantâ€™s origins are in Central and South Asia, where it was historically used for various purposes, including medicinal and ritualistic uses. Today, marijuana is cultivated worldwide, with varying regulations depending on the region. Its legal status ranges from full legalization in some places to complete prohibition in others, with many areas allowing it only for medical use.</p1>
